    "1. **What is a program?** A set of instructions to solve a specific task by a computer. Ex, computing tasks: provide input, perform calculations, output result. In this course, you will learn to write *console applications* (user interacts by typing text and watching text output on a console/terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is C++?** C++ is a programming language. We use it to describe the instructions in the computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do you write a \"C++ program\"?** Write C++ code in a text file. This text file is called the \"source code\". Provide the source code as input to a special program called \"compiler\" that will create an executable program out of your C++ source code. You can then run the executable just created.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. The C++ source code for a complete program is  little more complicated. With Jupyter, we can ignore the technicalities of a complete C++ program and focus on the C++ syntax in the beginning. You will write complete C++ programs in this course, shortly."
