    "3. **How do you write a \"C++ standalone program\"?** Write C++ code in a text file. This text file is called the \"source code\". Provide the source code as input to a special program called \"compiler\" that will create an executable program out of your C++ source code. You can then run the executable just created.\n",

A string is a sequence of characters (char).\n",
